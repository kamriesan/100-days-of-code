## Start
I started #100DaysofCode with the purpose of just getting used to programming and practicing logic regardless of whatever language. I used Java on the first days. But I‚Äôll be using C++ on most cases. My journey on getting familiar with C++. College is quite hectic and daily uploads may not be as possible for me, so I‚Äôm planning to just work on this on my own pace.¬†

# **Day 1: Feb. 21, 2022**

- **Today's Topics/Progress:** Learned basic Java Syntax
- **Thoughts:**¬†I completed the mandatory ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù program among others in¬†[Learn Java | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java). I also learned about classes, methods, print statements. Got frustrated for about 5 mins only to realize I should use the lowercase letter "L" instead of the uppercase "I" for¬†`System.out.println()`¬†ü§£

# **Day 2: Feb. 26, 2022**

- **Today's Topics/Progress:**¬†Created a simple Mad Lib program. Learned Java variables, operators, string concatenation
- **Thoughts**¬†Codeacademy instructs users to program a simple Mad Lib program. I researched what Mad Lib meant and realized its similarities with Cards Against Humanity. This gave me an app idea that I will be saving for later.

# **Day 3: March 23, 2022**

- **Today's Topics/Progress:**¬†Certification Exam Result Program
- **Thoughts:** This is a sample problem from my class that prints pass/fail in examinations (ex. College Entrance Tests). I learned how to work with booleans, and practiced using arrays in for loops. I'm hyped to write this because I had the rare chance of naming a variable 'catAss' üò∏. Aside from that, my programmming eureka happened during the creation of this program. I was able to confidently grasp C++ loops, if else statements, booleans, and logical operators.

# **Day 4: March 24, 2022**

- **Today's Topics/Progress:**¬†FizzBuzz program
- **Thoughts:**¬†This program outputs numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, it will print¬†`Fizz`¬†instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, it will print¬†`Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 it will print,¬†`FizzBuzz`.

# **Day 5: March 26, 2022**

- **Today's Topics/Progress:** Learned Linked and Binary Search Implementation (Data Structures and Algorithm)
- **Notes:**¬†Today, I just passively consumed learning materials about the following from freeCodeCamp‚Äôs¬†[Algorithms and Data Structures Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&t=2246s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org):
    - Linear Search Implementations
    - Binary Search

# **Day 6: March 27, 2022**

- **Today's Topics/Progress:**¬†Coding Contest program
- **Thoughts:** This program practices array and loop skills. It initially requires the number of teams for input. This value shall determine the number of loop iterations to print how many teams will be needed to input their details (Team Name, Team Course, Team Score). Next, the Contest Statistics will use all of the values inputted from the Team Scores, all shall be averaged. The program should print the Champion team, and all remainin teams with above average scores. Creating the [Certification Exam Result Program](https://github.com/kamriesan/100-Days-of-Code-Challenge/tree/main/Day%2003%20-%20Certification%20Exam%20Result) allowed me to understand arrays and loops. Making this program for today honed my programming logic speed.

# **Day 7: March 28, 2022**

- **Today's Topics/Progress:**¬†GPA Calculator
 **Thoughts:**¬†I had fun learning about arrays, so I wanted to try another machine problem about it to strengthen my mental muscle. I made a GWA Calculator that has a formula similar to the one I have in my university. This program idea is inspired by¬†[@ShaKKiroh](https://twitter.com/ShaKKiroh)¬†on Twitter.
    
    **Algorithm:**
    
    1. Input the course details; name, units, grade
    2. Compute for the summation of all total units
    3. Multiply the grade and number of units for each course
    4. Compute for the summation of all the product of grade and units
    5. For the final GWA, divide the product of each course grades and units to the Summation of all units.

# **Day 8: March 28, 2022**

- **Today's Topics/Progress:** Given 2 MxN matrix, display all matching elements, determine if the 2 matrices are equal or not.
- **Thoughts:**¬†I had a quite a struggle with setting the logical operators for the array size.
- **Link to work:** [Matrices Equality](https://github.com/kamriesan/100-days-of-code/blob/master/projects/Day%2008%20-%20Matrices%20Equality/Matrices%20Equality.cpp)

# Day 9: April 4, 2022

- **Today's Topics/Progress:** Created a program that multiplies matrices
- **Thoughts:**¬†The logic behind this one's extra challenging. Nevertheless, it was quite fun to code.
- **Link to work:** [Matrices Multiplication](https://github.com/kamriesan/100-days-of-code/blob/master/projects/Day%2009%20-%20Matrices%20Multiplication/C%20Program%20for%20Matrix%20Multiplication.c)

# Day 10: April 5, 2022

- **Today's Topics/Progress:** Learned Pointers + Created a mini-program that helped me organize my Notion and 100 days of Code Documentation
- **Thoughts:** For learning about pointers, I finished half of NesoAcademy‚Äôs videos. I finally knew more about pointers which had been lagging me from my college classes. Also, I experienced one of the great joys in coding‚Äîit‚Äôs being able to automate personal tasks. While seemingly menial, this has been fulfilling as I am able to use coding to aid me in a personal task.
- **Task:** I wanted to copy-paste the format of 100 days of code in a Notion Page to set it for the future from my current progress up to Day 100. I initially made something without  text formatting until I realized I could use Notion‚Äôs built-in which is also recognizable in my GitHub repository. This has been exciting as it has been the first time I was able to use coding to aid me in something.
